# Bike-sharing-demand-project
Problem description- Currently Rental bikes are introduced in many urban cities for the enhancement of mobility comfort. It is important to make the rental bike available and accessible to the public at the right time as it lessens the waiting time. Eventually, providing the city with a stable supply of rental bikes becomes a major concern. The crucial part is the prediction of bike count required at each hour for the stable supply of rental bikes.
Data Description-The dataset contains weather information(Temperature, Humidity, Windspeed, Visibility, Dewpoint, Solar radiation,Snowfall, Rainfall), the number of bikes rented per hour and date information.
During the time of our analysis, we initially did EDA on all the features of our datset. We first analysed our dependent variable, 'Rented Bike Count' and also transformed it. Next we analysed categorical variable and dropped the variable who had majority of one class, we also analysed numerical variable, found out the correlation, distribution and their relationship with the dependent variable. We also removed some numerical features who had mostly 0 values and hot encoded the categorical variables.
Next we implemented 7 machine learning algorithms Linear Regression,lasso,ridge,elasticnet,decission tree, Random Forest and XGBoost. We did hyperparameter tuning to improve our model performance.
